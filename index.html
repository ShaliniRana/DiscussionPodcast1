<h3>Summary of Readings</h3>

    <p>In the HTML5 reading, I learned that HTML5 improved previous web applications that were on the HTML4 markup language. HTML5 is NOT one big thing and is composed of many features to make a webpage. This version allows you to use new semantic elements that are not in the previous versions. However, HTML4 code can still be rendered in HTML5. Headers, in HTML5, allow the computer to read the following markup in the code; the content-type header is the most important one! The ‘text/html’ is what follows the content-type header and is called the MIME type. Something interesting is that HTML tags were created by people in a time (the 1990s) when there were very few web servers and the World Wide Web was a new thing. Some computer guys came together on a discussion board on the WWW in order to decide what tags should be used in HTML. Tim-Berners Lee, the inventor of WWW, posted on this page too! The crazy thing is, none of the browsers from 1993 exist today in recognizable form. For example, remember Microsoft Plus! in Windows 95? How about Netscape Navigator? HTML forms are continuing to be extended today. In the VT shaped learner readings, I learned about VT’s new education model they are planning to roll out. The VT shaped student is the new plan to form the model student at Virginia Tech, which will hopefully be all students. The goal is to make classes in the arts, sciences, and technology required for all students in order to blend both right brain and left brain and go “beyond boundaries.” While I do think the V and T model is a bit confusing and not completely intuitive, I like the idea in theory, and understand how it is used as a marketing tool for the university. I am curious to see how this new education model develops in the coming years.</p>
